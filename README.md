# envoy-extproc-payloadlimit-demo-go

This repository contains a demo application written in Go that demonstrates the usage of Envoy's External Processor (ExtProc) filter to do `payload limit` for POST request.

## Overview

The Envoy ExtProc filter allows you to offload request processing logic to an external process, enabling you to customize and extend Envoy's functionality. This demo application showcases how to implement an ExtProc filter in Go.

## Features

   + Integration with Envoy's External Processor filter
   + Customizable request processing logic
   + Demonstrates handling of HTTP requests in Go
   + Simple and easy-to-understand codebase

## Getting Started

To get started with the demo application, follow these steps:

  1. Clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/projectsesame/envoy-extproc-payloadlimit-demo-go.git
     ```

  2. Build the Go application:
     ```
     go build .
     ```

  3. Run the application:
     ```
     ./envoy-extproc-payloadlimit-demo-go payload-limit --log-stream --log-phases payload-limit 32
     ```


## Usage

The demo application listens for incoming GRPC requests on a specified port and performs custom processing logic. You can modify the processing logic in the application code according to your requirements.
